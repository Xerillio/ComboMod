## How to work on this project ##
This is how to set it up if you are working with eclipse. Steps 1 to 4 should be the same for all IDEs but check other guides on how to set it up for other IDEs than eclipse.

1. Clone/fork this repository.
2. Download the Minecraft Forge source files for the version you want to develop for (see [Project Information](#project-info) for the current version of this project.
3. Extract the source files into the root directory of your local repository. Skip files that already exist, i.e. don't overwrite.
4. Run the file named "setup_workspace.bat".
5. When finished (should close the command window automatically) run "setup_eclipse.bat" and wait for it to finish.
6. Open eclipse and set the workspace as the "eclipse" folder in your repository.
